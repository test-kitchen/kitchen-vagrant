# Kitchen::Vagrant

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/kitchen-vagrant.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/kitchen-vagrant)

A Test Kitchen Driver for Vagrant.

This driver works by generating a single Vagrantfile for each instance in a
sandboxed directory. Since the Vagrantfile is written out on disk, Vagrant
needs absolutely no knowledge of Test Kitchen. So no Vagrant plugins are
required.

## Requirements

### Vagrant

A Vagrant version of 1.6 or later.

## Installation

The kitchen-vagrant driver ships as part of Chef Workstation. The easiest way to use this driver is to [Download Chef Workstation](https://www.chef.io/downloads/tools/workstation).

If you want to install the driver directly into a Ruby installation:

```sh
gem install kitchen-vagrant
```

If you're using Bundler, simply add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "kitchen-vagrant"
```

... and then run `bundle install`.

## Configuration and Usage

See the [kitchen.ci Vagrant Driver Page](https://kitchen.ci/docs/drivers/vagrant/) for documentation on configuring this driver.

## Development

* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]
* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.
Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For
example:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
